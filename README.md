# Give Me Some Credit
## Project Objective: To build a Classification Model to Detect the Likelihood of Borrower Default
This project will explore the factors that have an affect on a borrower's likelihood to repay. The data source is from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/GiveMeSomeCredit/"> Kaggle's Give me Some Credit</a>

I will walk you through an exploratory data analysis of a dataset comprising of 11 features and 150,000 records. After which, I will train three classification models: 1) Logistic Regression, 2) Random Forest Classification, and 3) XGBoost Classification. Each model is evaluated using a ROC curve/AUC score. AUC scores range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfectly explanatory model, and 0 reflects the inverse (a perfectly incorrect model). A score of 0.5 indicates that the model is no better at explaining the probability of an outcome than a random guess. 

The dataset is taken from Kaggle and was originally created for the intended purpose of building credit scoring models. It consists of features that can be used to probabilistically determine the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan or not.

Accurately classifying a borrower is important to financial institutions as it mitigates the risk of credit default. Furthermore, the integrated adoption of such a model can help decision makers to recommend appropriate financial instruments to consumers.
